# Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV-for-Python
Simple face recognition using cv2
if you want to use the script with help of GPU to increase the FPS
use (pip install -v --install-option="--no" --install-option="DLIB_USE_CUDA" dlib) in your terminal
DO NOT name the script Face Recognition.py, becouse in the script you have to call Face Recognition.py function which is gonna call your same script which leads to a big ass error you stupid
